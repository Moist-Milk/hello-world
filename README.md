I am a lonesome dairy farmer looking for other single dairy farmers in my area that enjoy techno music, lamp collecting, and laser pointers. I believe that humans are are a genetic experiments placed on earth by the Anunnaki from pleiades to mine precious metals from the earth so they can power their alien technology and space crafts.
